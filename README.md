<h1 align-"center">S.A.U.C.E. 2.0.</h1>
<p>

  S.A.U.C.E. or Structural Analysis Using Contactless Evaluation is a small contactless device that is designed to assess, analyze, and monitor the structural integrity of manufactured structures by utilizing object detection technology, thermal imaging, range finding, and vibrational monitors. The information gathered is collected and stored for further analysis. Version 2.0 is a continuation of our original project with a newfound focus on portability and compatibility with robotic systems that would allow us to expand on the existing features by allowing use in locations that would otherwise be inaccessible.
  
  Designed as an entry into the NASA Minds project.
 
## Selected Technology Stack

### Dashboard

  The Dashboard sub folder contains the python code for displaying metrics and a general control panel for our device.

#### Requires
  See requirements.txt for a comprehensive list of what we require and what versions.

  To install, run:
  ``` 
  pip install -r requirements.txt 
  ```

#### To Run
  index.py is the primary dashboard server, simply run it locally to use until a proper production build is made.

#### To Host
  Port 8080 needs to be forwarded - App will function without but only locally

## Helpers

  The helpers subdirectory is a set of scripts necessary for major parts of our project to function, such as live video streaming from the S.A.U.C.E. module itself.
